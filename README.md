## 📊 Statistical Modeling & Time Series Projects

This repository includes educational projects focused on statistical regression and time series analysis. Each project is documented in Markdown and exported to PDF for clarity and reproducibility.

### 1. 📈 Statistical Regression Modeling (Markdown → PDF)

Projects cover a range of classical statistical models for supervised learning and inference:

- **(a) Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** – Relationship between a single independent and dependent variable  
- **(b) ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** – Statistical testing for group mean comparisons  
- **(c) Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** – Modeling multiple predictors simultaneously  
- **(d) Generalized Linear Models (GLM)** – Extension of linear models to non-normal distributions (e.g., logistic, Poisson)

### 2. ⏱️ Time Series Analysis (Markdown → PDF)

Hands-on projects analyzing time-dependent data using both univariate and multivariate techniques:

- **(a) Trend and Seasonality Decomposition** – Identifying and separating components in time series data  
- **(b) Autoregression & Moving Average (AR, MA)** – Basic time series models for short-term forecasting  
- **(c) ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)** – Modeling non-stationary time series  
- **(d) VAR & GARCH Models** –  
  - **VAR (Vector Autoregression):** Multivariate time series modeling  
  - **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity):** Volatility modeling in financial time series
